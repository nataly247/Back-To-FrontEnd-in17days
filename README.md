# Back-To-FrontEnd-in17days

So. I was learning FrontEnd for some time. Than make some pauses. Than learn again. Than paid attention to other subjects like quality assurance, blockchain and Solidity programmimg and some other cool stuff. And it was great too, of course. But I realised that nothing makes me more happy than creating beautiful things with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. So, I'm back to FrontEnd Development again and I want to make very quick revision of what I've already learned and deside there do I go next to improve my skills.

And I guess will be logical to start with "Hello word!" of course and claiming to the world that I'm a Developer)
